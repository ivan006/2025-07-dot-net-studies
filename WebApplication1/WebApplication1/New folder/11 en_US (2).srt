00:00.960 --> 00:07.440
We had to take a detour to understand dependency injection before we understand the next file, which

00:07.440 --> 00:09.090
is startup right here.

00:09.690 --> 00:16.800
You can right click here and go to the definition, or you can open up the startup file from here itself.

00:16.890 --> 00:24.000
Now, startup class, as you can see, is a basic class with no extensions or implementations of interface.

00:24.120 --> 00:29.100
But the first thing that you notice if you scroll down is that there are two methods.

00:29.400 --> 00:34.860
The first one is the configure services and the next one is the configure method.

00:35.310 --> 00:40.620
Both of these methods are invoked automatically by ASP.Net Core.

00:41.130 --> 00:44.250
Configure services gets called first.

00:44.580 --> 00:51.480
We will be registering all the dependencies with dependency injection container that is built in in

00:51.480 --> 00:55.240
ASP.Net Core within the configure services.

00:55.260 --> 01:02.860
So that is why I wanted to introduce you to dependency injection in the previous video, because configure

01:02.860 --> 01:07.930
services is the place where you do the registration of your service.

01:08.320 --> 01:15.280
If we switch back to the PowerPoint, the step that we do when we register our email and database with

01:15.280 --> 01:21.730
interface as well as the implementation, that is the step that we will do inside configure services

01:21.730 --> 01:22.510
method.

01:22.630 --> 01:29.620
So inside the configure services method, we can add services to the collection of services.

01:30.190 --> 01:37.420
Services are basically any functionality that you want to register so other parts of application can

01:37.420 --> 01:38.260
use it.

01:38.380 --> 01:42.400
As we saw, it could be email database and much more.

01:42.820 --> 01:49.990
We will be registering the services provided by the Dotnet core framework as well as custom services

01:49.990 --> 01:51.520
that we will create.

01:51.910 --> 01:58.570
As of now, you can see right here we just have one services which is add controllers with views.

01:58.570 --> 02:03.670
And with this we register MVC service to our application.

02:04.300 --> 02:06.970
We will be adding more services here.

02:06.970 --> 02:13.240
But before we dive into MVC in the next video, let's understand the configure method.

02:13.690 --> 02:20.560
But remember that configure services method gets called by the runtime and we use this method to add

02:20.560 --> 02:22.570
services to our container.

02:23.110 --> 02:26.320
That being said, let's continue in the next video.
