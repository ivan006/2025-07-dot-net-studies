00:01.060 --> 00:06.700
In the previous video we saw what will be done in part one of this course.

00:06.910 --> 00:12.310
That being said, as the name suggests, there will be a part two to this course.

00:12.520 --> 00:18.970
So in part two, let me show you what enhancements we will be doing and what are things that you should

00:18.970 --> 00:21.040
look for with part one.

00:21.040 --> 00:24.240
The business requirement was not that detailed.

00:24.250 --> 00:29.740
All they wanted was list all the products and submit an inquiry in an email.

00:30.040 --> 00:33.520
But with part two, the requirements have changed.

00:33.790 --> 00:38.320
What they want now is they want a complete order management system.

00:38.320 --> 00:45.820
The orders will only be placed by admin users and that is because with paving companies, customers

00:45.820 --> 00:47.290
do not place the order.

00:47.320 --> 00:54.670
They either go in the store, select stone or they call admin and they place the order for square feet.

00:54.880 --> 01:01.550
So customer side of the website remains the same, but admin has completely changed.

01:01.550 --> 01:05.720
For part two, let's log in as an admin user.

01:06.320 --> 01:13.220
When we go to log in, you see the page registration has changed and we also have Facebook login.

01:13.760 --> 01:19.310
That being said, let me log in using the admin user with content management.

01:19.340 --> 01:22.550
Now we see order and inquiry management.

01:22.580 --> 01:28.280
Before we dive into these concepts, let's try to place an order and see what's different.

01:28.580 --> 01:34.190
So now if admin registers, they have a square feet that they have to enter.

01:34.780 --> 01:40.480
So we'll enter five square feet add and let's add one more product to the cart.

01:40.690 --> 01:46.930
We have sweet notifications here which displays the task has been completed successfully.

01:47.520 --> 01:54.570
Then if we go on shopping cart in our shopping cart, admin can update the square feet if they want.

01:54.780 --> 01:57.570
Based on that, the price will be updated.

01:58.020 --> 02:04.980
Admin can hit continue here and they have to enter details of the user who wants the order.

02:09.240 --> 02:15.600
They will enter the customer details, make sure the summary looks good and they need to enter the credit

02:15.600 --> 02:17.160
card for the customer.

02:17.400 --> 02:24.990
Here we are using Braintree for credit card processing, so we will enter the credit card for Braintree,

02:25.230 --> 02:29.190
a valid expiration date and we'll hit the submit order.

02:29.840 --> 02:36.620
With that, we have the same inquiry confirmation view, but now we see order created and order number

02:36.620 --> 02:37.970
is being displayed.

02:38.760 --> 02:42.060
So with this order has been placed successfully.

02:42.480 --> 02:48.780
That being said, if you recall in part one, we were submitting the inquiries, but we were not storing

02:48.780 --> 02:49.290
them.

02:49.470 --> 02:54.150
Now we will also store all the inquiries that any user submits.

02:54.420 --> 03:01.890
Then in the saved inquiry admin can come directly here, click on edit and they can convert it to Cart.

03:01.890 --> 03:08.740
And all the four products that are there in this inquiry will be added to their shopping cart here.

03:08.760 --> 03:15.030
Then admin can change the square feet based on how they want it and they can hit continue and we'll

03:15.030 --> 03:16.650
see the summarize total.

03:16.920 --> 03:24.060
The thing that is different in inquiry is name, phone number and email gets populated automatically

03:24.060 --> 03:27.280
for the user who submitted the inquiry.

03:27.300 --> 03:29.940
These are not the details about admin.

03:29.970 --> 03:33.990
These details are about the user who created the inquiry.

03:34.730 --> 03:36.170
Then it's the same thing.

03:36.170 --> 03:40.130
They can enter the credit card and place order for the customer.

03:40.340 --> 03:47.390
Then we go to order here and we have order management screen and we have the filterings that user can

03:47.390 --> 03:47.960
do.

03:48.170 --> 03:53.270
They can tweak things based on the order status and however they want.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.490
Inside order management.

03:55.490 --> 03:58.130
What we are using here is sync fusion.

03:58.400 --> 04:05.300
We have few functionalities that are available right out of the box with sync fusion, but what advantage

04:05.300 --> 04:12.980
this brings as compared to data tables inside inquiry is that if you have 10,000 or 100,000 records

04:13.010 --> 04:17.030
loading, all of them will make your website really slow.

04:17.180 --> 04:24.260
If you go to the order here with Sync Fusion, you can add filter clauses to make sure you do not populate

04:24.260 --> 04:26.030
all the data at once.

04:26.060 --> 04:29.360
You can only populate the data that you want.

04:29.980 --> 04:32.230
So that is one advantage there.

04:32.230 --> 04:37.540
And Syncfusion has many other controls you can use there, other controls.

04:37.540 --> 04:42.640
But I will explain you how to configure Syncfusion in your project.

04:43.240 --> 04:50.560
Then if we scroll down, we have the pagination and if admin goes into any of the details here, they

04:50.560 --> 04:56.410
can update the order details for the customer or they can start processing of the order.

04:56.650 --> 04:58.840
The order ID here is nine.

04:58.840 --> 05:03.940
So once we hit start processing we have the order is in process alert.

05:03.970 --> 05:09.100
If we go on the next screen for order nine, the status is processing.

05:09.280 --> 05:14.620
If we go in details now next status that is available is shipped the order.

05:15.100 --> 05:20.320
Once they hit ship the order, then the order will be successfully completed.

05:20.470 --> 05:27.290
So if we go here, the order has been shipped and the only option that is available now is cancel order.

05:27.310 --> 05:29.140
If something goes wrong.

05:29.810 --> 05:31.010
With cancel order.

05:31.010 --> 05:35.510
We have to make sure that we need to provide refund to the customer as well.

05:35.930 --> 05:43.250
So when you hit cancel order, it will not only update the status to cancelled, but it will also refund

05:43.250 --> 05:44.090
the order.

05:44.570 --> 05:50.960
We will see all of these transactions in real time and see the status of the transactions.

05:51.380 --> 05:55.580
This is just the overview of the functionality of the application.

05:55.580 --> 05:58.410
But part two is not just about that.

05:58.430 --> 06:02.480
When we will be adding so many new features to our website.

06:02.510 --> 06:05.120
This is not a small scale website anymore.

06:05.300 --> 06:11.720
So the main thing that we'll be focusing on is architecting our website, the correct way, implementing

06:11.720 --> 06:16.720
repository pattern and how to make sure that your website is scalable.

06:16.730 --> 06:23.120
If you have to convert it from a small scale to large scale, that task is not easy.

06:23.150 --> 06:29.850
You will face many errors there, but I will show you everything on how to resolve and architect the

06:29.850 --> 06:31.350
website correctly.

06:31.650 --> 06:38.460
So I hope you are as excited as I am with this course and I hope to see you in the part two of this

06:38.460 --> 06:39.630
course as well.
