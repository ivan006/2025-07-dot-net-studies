In this video, I want to introduce you to Appsettings.json.

00:06.150 --> 00:12.060
This is the file in which we will be adding all of the connection, strings and static files like secrets

00:12.060 --> 00:15.120
that we want in a production application.

00:15.120 --> 00:22.020
You can move this to vaults or secrets, but we'll be using Appsettings for this course here.

00:22.020 --> 00:26.790
Right now we see the logging and in that we have some things that have been configured.

00:27.090 --> 00:33.660
We will be adding connection strings along with other things in this course inside the app settings,

00:34.050 --> 00:40.170
whenever there are any keys or anything that we want to use throughout the course, it is a great place

00:40.170 --> 00:41.970
to store them right here.

00:42.900 --> 00:49.050
That being said, we'll come back to this file and we'll be adding new things in the upcoming videos.
