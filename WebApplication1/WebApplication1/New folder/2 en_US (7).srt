Whenever we are building any project we want to see what is the final application that we will be building.

00:08.430 --> 00:12.060
For that you have to go to Dotnet mastery.com.

00:12.060 --> 00:17.880
And if you go to courses here, you have to select the appropriate course that you are on.

00:18.180 --> 00:22.920
We are on the ASP.Net Core MVC up and running part one.

00:22.920 --> 00:26.880
And when you click on details, we have the live preview.

00:27.490 --> 00:34.300
So let's click there and it will take us to the live preview of the application that we will be building.

00:34.950 --> 00:35.520
Here.

00:35.520 --> 00:42.840
You can see we have filtering on the category for all of the paving stones that we have or that the

00:42.840 --> 00:44.400
customer is selling.

00:45.060 --> 00:51.150
Then for each one of them, you can view the details and you can add them to the shopping cart.

00:51.540 --> 00:55.590
Once you add those, the shopping cart gets populated.

00:55.920 --> 01:01.200
If you go back and try to add it one more time, you do not see that option.

01:01.230 --> 01:05.010
Next option that you see is removed from cart.

01:05.490 --> 01:10.170
Then on the right hand side, you see we have login and registration.

01:10.320 --> 01:14.820
You can always register for a new account for demo purposes.

01:14.820 --> 01:19.110
I have already created two accounts for admin user.

01:19.110 --> 01:24.150
It is admin at gmail and for customer it is user at Gmail.

01:24.690 --> 01:27.840
Let's first log in using the customer account.

01:30.300 --> 01:37.830
So I have entered the username and password and those details are available right here in the info bubble.

01:37.860 --> 01:41.070
You can always create new accounts if you want.

01:41.520 --> 01:48.400
So once we log in as the user, you can see we are back to the home page and if you click on the shopping

01:48.400 --> 01:51.670
cart you can see the products that you added.

01:52.370 --> 01:56.990
Then you can remove the products if you want or you can hit continue here.

01:57.170 --> 02:01.580
When you created the account, you entered name, phone number and email.

02:01.580 --> 02:04.850
So that is populated automatically for you.

02:05.270 --> 02:10.880
You can also change this, but if you think this is good, you can submit an enquiry.

02:11.810 --> 02:15.680
Once you submit an inquiry, an email will be sent out.

02:16.280 --> 02:21.860
Here, I'm just displaying a sample email that will be sent out to the admin user.

02:21.890 --> 02:28.460
It displays a new inquiry, was submitted with customer details and the products they are interested

02:28.460 --> 02:29.000
in.

02:29.810 --> 02:35.750
So that's all the functionalities that a user or a customer can do on our website.

02:36.350 --> 02:38.390
That being said, this is not it.

02:38.420 --> 02:43.190
If we log out and this time let's log in as an admin user.

02:44.870 --> 02:51.980
When you log in as an admin user, you will see there are new tab is available in your navigation bar

02:52.190 --> 02:54.590
and that is content management.

02:54.740 --> 03:02.780
In here you have the category in which you can perform Crud operations on category like create a category,

03:02.780 --> 03:06.650
edit a category or delete any of the existing category.

03:07.040 --> 03:14.630
Now on the demo website I will have disabled the update functionality to avoid misuse of the application.

03:14.750 --> 03:17.720
But here we will be adding validations.

03:18.170 --> 03:23.720
So we'll have Crud operations for category application type and products.

03:24.020 --> 03:30.390
Products will be more complex as compared to category because here we have much more things.

03:30.630 --> 03:34.580
We'll be displaying a rich text box here to add styling.

03:34.590 --> 03:39.960
They can change the image and they have to select category and application type.

03:40.730 --> 03:46.370
Along with that, there will be validations and complex logic that you have to take care of.

03:46.610 --> 03:49.820
So you can always play around with the demo here.

03:49.820 --> 03:55.520
And with the demo, you will always know what is the next step of designing that will be doing.

03:55.940 --> 04:03.020
So that being said, from the next video, let's start with the basics of ASP.Net Core and continue

04:03.020 --> 04:05.000
to build this awesome demo.
