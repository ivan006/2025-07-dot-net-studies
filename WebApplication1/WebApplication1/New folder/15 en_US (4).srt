00:01.400 --> 00:01.820
Next.

00:01.820 --> 00:06.860
What we want to see here is we have a folder called w w, w Root.

00:07.640 --> 00:12.500
This folder has been created since we selected the MVC application.

00:12.950 --> 00:19.370
In here, if you expand this, there are more folders that has static files for our application.

00:19.730 --> 00:25.640
Static files could be CSS, JavaScript or any of the third party libraries.

00:26.630 --> 00:30.980
You can also have images here or HTML templates.

00:31.720 --> 00:39.430
If you remember in Startup.cs, if we go there, we added a middleware use static files and that was

00:39.430 --> 00:46.360
added so that the application can use the static files that we add inside W.w.w root.

00:46.990 --> 00:54.250
This W.w.w root folder will be the root folder in application for all static files.

00:54.460 --> 00:58.480
None of the C sharp files will be placed in this folder.

00:58.810 --> 01:04.210
This folder is only meant to serve all the static files for our application.

01:05.020 --> 01:12.100
So we'll be using the static files folder extensively throughout the course when we have to add images

01:12.100 --> 01:18.160
or we want to add any class libraries or we want to modify external CSS.

01:18.640 --> 01:23.680
Once we have that, the last thing that we have is launch Settings.json.

01:24.460 --> 01:32.140
Launch Settings.json is inside the properties folder and if we double click it displays different profile

01:32.140 --> 01:34.450
in which we can run the application.

01:35.020 --> 01:41.710
Like here, if the profile is IIS express, it sets the environment variable for that profile to be

01:41.710 --> 01:42.700
development.

01:43.330 --> 01:51.220
This way you can configure more profiles that you want with the URL as a support and other functionalities.

01:51.760 --> 01:57.580
Also, when we will run the application right here, we will be seeing all the profiles that we have

01:57.580 --> 02:00.220
set up inside the launch settings.

02:00.430 --> 02:05.510
So right here you can see IIS express and we have the rocky profile URL.

02:06.020 --> 02:11.690
If you want to modify them, you can modify here directly or you can also do the same.

02:11.690 --> 02:14.090
If you right click here and here.

02:14.090 --> 02:19.340
If you go to the properties, we will be having those profiles in the debug tab.

02:19.460 --> 02:24.110
So right here you see IIS Express as well as Rocky.

02:24.140 --> 02:29.840
We can set the browser URL and we can set the environment variables that we want.

02:29.870 --> 02:36.560
Here we have the other settings which you can set from that page or we can do in the launch settings

02:36.560 --> 02:37.610
dot Json.

02:38.030 --> 02:42.500
Now we won't be tweaking this much because this is more related to deployment.

02:42.500 --> 02:48.650
And if you want to add more environment variable for like staging another environment, but we'll just

02:48.650 --> 02:51.080
keep it with the basic for this course.
