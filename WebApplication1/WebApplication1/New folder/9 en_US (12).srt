00:01.000 --> 00:05.710
Next important file that I want to show you is the Program.cs.

00:05.860 --> 00:11.620
Now, we won't be going through all the files in the same order, but I will be going through them in

00:11.620 --> 00:14.890
an order that will be easier for you to understand.

00:15.550 --> 00:17.410
The next file will be taking a look.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.520
Is the Program.cs.

00:19.600 --> 00:23.650
If we scroll down here, you will see that there is a main method.

00:24.070 --> 00:31.720
Main method is more common in console application, and the reason you see that here is initially Dotnet

00:31.720 --> 00:35.710
core application starts as a console application.

00:35.980 --> 00:40.570
The main method configures ASP.Net Core and starts it.

00:41.110 --> 00:48.370
The configuration is done by calling the create host builder and as you can see, this is a method in

00:48.370 --> 00:57.430
the program class which returns an object of a host builder on this object, build and run are called,

00:57.430 --> 01:03.560
and then onwards the application will become an ASP.Net Core application.

01:04.190 --> 01:11.720
The Create Host Builder calls Default Builder, which configures the web host using defaults.

01:12.050 --> 01:17.210
Also, you can see the web builder is configured using the startup file.

01:17.660 --> 01:24.830
Before we take a look at the startup file in detail, let's understand a core concept of ASP.Net Core,

01:24.830 --> 01:26.960
which is dependency injection.
