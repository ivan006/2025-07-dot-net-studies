00:01.180 --> 00:07.690
Our project has been created and it's time to take a look at the files and folders that we have inside

00:07.690 --> 00:08.740
our project.

00:08.890 --> 00:13.570
The first file will be the project file that we will be taking a look at.

00:13.900 --> 00:19.990
For that, if you right click on the project, you will see the option of edit project file.

00:20.440 --> 00:24.820
Other way of accessing that file is just double click on Rocky.

00:25.030 --> 00:28.090
That will load the project file by default.

00:28.600 --> 00:34.900
Now here in the project file, you should notice the target framework that we are using is net core

00:34.940 --> 00:35.950
app five.

00:36.250 --> 00:41.380
So this will be the dot net framework that we will be using for our solution.

00:41.920 --> 00:47.860
If you are using 3.1 or 3.0, that is the version you will see right here.

00:48.310 --> 00:54.550
Then we have few more elements and the other important entity will be the item group.

00:54.940 --> 01:01.160
Item group will have all of the third party packages that we will be installing in our project.

01:01.400 --> 01:08.150
Right now, when we created the project, we selected the runtime compilation on the project options

01:08.330 --> 01:12.590
because of which it has added that NuGet package right here.

01:12.860 --> 01:19.700
When we will be adding more packages like we'll be adding database packages, email packages, all of

01:19.700 --> 01:26.690
those will be added in the item group and will be watching them once we add new packages in the upcoming

01:26.690 --> 01:27.620
videos.

01:27.890 --> 01:32.510
When you have to add the package, you do not have to come here and manually add the line.

01:32.510 --> 01:35.660
We will be doing that using NuGet packages.

01:35.690 --> 01:38.930
That being said, this looks good for our project file.

01:38.930 --> 01:42.440
Let's continue with the other files in the next video.
