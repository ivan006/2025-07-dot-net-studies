00:01.020 --> 00:07.350
Now before I run the application and show you routing in detail, let's take a look at the folders that

00:07.350 --> 00:10.740
we have with model views and controllers.

00:11.420 --> 00:17.720
So right here we have a home controller, and in the model we have the error view model.

00:17.960 --> 00:24.830
Whenever we'll be adding new models or if we want to add a new table in the database, we will be adding

00:24.830 --> 00:26.960
models inside this folder.

00:27.610 --> 00:32.590
Controller, as we know, is the heart of the application in controller.

00:32.590 --> 00:36.640
If you expand this, you see there are many of the functions.

00:36.760 --> 00:40.150
These are known as individual action method.

00:40.810 --> 00:43.600
So a controller has action method.

00:43.630 --> 00:50.110
If we go back to the routing template that we had, we had the controller name and the action name.

00:50.710 --> 00:58.270
So what means is if someone calls index, then they can call it home forward slash index and the control

00:58.270 --> 01:02.560
will hit this breakpoint when the URL is submitted.

01:02.740 --> 01:06.970
And once the control gets here, we are just returning back the View.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.730
So this view will be inside the views folder and inside the home folder.

01:12.910 --> 01:16.780
The folder name will match exactly as the controller name.

01:16.930 --> 01:24.190
So it will look for an index view inside the home folder, inside views, and that will correspond to

01:24.190 --> 01:27.130
the action method that we see right here.

01:27.830 --> 01:33.170
So what we have in the index view is if you open it, we have a title.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.940
We have welcome here.

01:34.940 --> 01:39.440
And then we have learned about building web apps with ASP.Net Core.

01:40.100 --> 01:44.060
Let's run this and make sure that this is actually working.

01:44.240 --> 01:48.230
So let's run our application for the first time and create.

01:48.260 --> 01:50.300
We see that page is loaded.

01:50.750 --> 01:55.490
Now, right here in the URL, we do not see any controller or action name.

01:55.730 --> 02:02.060
And the reason is, if we go back to the application in startup, we configured the default to home

02:02.060 --> 02:03.920
controller index action.

02:04.370 --> 02:10.820
So that being said, if you add a debugging point right here and if you go back and press enter, you

02:10.820 --> 02:13.160
will see that it hits this breakpoint.

02:13.310 --> 02:18.590
So it is actually calling the index action method inside your home controller.

02:19.220 --> 02:23.420
That being said, let's continue here and the view is loaded.

02:23.570 --> 02:26.360
Now, what will happen when we click privacy?

02:26.720 --> 02:33.440
You can see in the URL on the bottom here it is going to home controller and privacy action method.

02:33.860 --> 02:40.550
So right here inside home controller, we have the privacy action method, which just returns back a

02:40.550 --> 02:41.150
view.

02:41.540 --> 02:44.480
That view will again be inside views home.

02:44.480 --> 02:49.700
And we have the privacy view and this is what we should see when we click that.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.430
Let's go back and click here.

02:52.460 --> 02:57.290
Now you can see the control is getting to the privacy action method.

02:57.290 --> 03:01.700
And if you hit continue, the privacy view will be loaded.

03:02.510 --> 03:03.020
Great.

03:03.020 --> 03:06.260
So we can see how routing is working so far.

03:06.410 --> 03:13.460
Right now we do not have any ID, Even if you add an ID, it will still load the privacy because ID

03:13.460 --> 03:14.630
is optional.

03:14.810 --> 03:18.380
So if you have it or if you do not, that doesn't matter.

03:18.800 --> 03:25.730
So with this routing is making a little bit more sense on how the controllers and view routing works.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.480
One thing you should always remember is if your name is home controller, you should have a folder within

03:32.480 --> 03:39.260
the view with the name home, and in there you will add all the views corresponding to the action methods

03:39.260 --> 03:41.240
inside the home controller.

03:41.360 --> 03:45.830
That being said, right here, there are few more views that I want to explain you.

03:45.860 --> 03:48.170
Let me do that in the next video.
